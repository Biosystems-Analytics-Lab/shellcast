All the files in this sub-directory were generated by the [ndfd_analyze_forecast_data_script.R](https://github.ncsu.edu/biosystemsanalyticslab/shellcast/blob/master/analysis/ndfd_analyze_forecast_data_script.R). See this R script for more details.

These files have the same format of ndfd_cmu_calcs.csv, ndfd_lease_calcs.csv, and ndfd_sga_calcs.csv but the data is appended for to include all days, not just the currrent day. We do this to save past probabilty of closure calculations.

**NOTE:** These data are no longer used in (and tracked by) ShellCast.
