README notes

rainfall_thresholds.csv
This tabular data comes from manually reformatting Test.xlsx. Manually added grow_area by looking at which CMUs in Conditional_Management_Units.shp laid within (since I don't have growing area polygons). Added ha_class_desc column by looking at HA_CLASS names. Added sheilagoogle_ha_class_desc columns by looking at CMUs on Google Maps.

rainfall_thresholds_no_ga.csv
This comes from rainfall_thresholds.csv but deleted the grow_area column and kept only distinct rows.
