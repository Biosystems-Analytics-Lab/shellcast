All the files in this directory were generated by the [ndfd_convert_df_to_raster_script.R](/analysis/ndfd_convert_df_to_raster_script.R). See this R script for more details.

The naming convention for .tiff files in this directory is as follows. The first part of the file name ("pop" or "qpf") refers to the NDFD variable of interest: probability of precipitation (pop) as a percent and quantitative precipitation forecast (qpf) in kg/m^2. The second part of the file name refers to the validation period (24 hr, 42 hr, or 72 hr). The last part of the file name (nc_alblers) means that the file is clipped to NC bounds and has been projected from the NDFD projection to CONUS Albers Equal Area Conic (EPSG = 5070).
