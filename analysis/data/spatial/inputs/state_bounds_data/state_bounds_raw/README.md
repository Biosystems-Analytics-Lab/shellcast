**State_Boundaries.shp** - This file represents the state boundaries for the United States and was originally downloaded from https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/f8730991034b46d2bed73a16a96765c6_55?geometry=166.851%2C13.656%2C8.823%2C59.927. Metdata can be found at https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f8730991034b46d2bed73a16a96765c6. It was downloaded on 20201102. This is a little more detailed in terms of the outline for the coastal plane so I decided to use the TIGER data instead. I'm keeping this here for now.
