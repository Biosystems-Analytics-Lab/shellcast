All files in this directory were generated by [ncdmf_tidy_state_bounds_script.R](/analysis/ncdmf_tidy_state_bounds_script.R). See this R script for more details.

**NOTE:** Each .shp file is accompanied by several other files (e.g., .dpf, .prj, .shx, etc.). These files will have the same prefix (i.e., file descriptive name before the file extension) and to be downloaded together and stored together for the .shp file to functionp properly in any GIS program.

**state_bounds_albers.shp** - This file represents the state boundaries for the United States. I projected State_Boundaries.shp in the state_bounds_raw directory to CONUS Albers Equal Area Conic (EPSG = 5070).

**nc_bounds_albers.shp** - This file represents the NC state boundary which was filtered from state_bounds_albers.shp (EPSG = 5070).

**nc_bounds_10kmbuf_albers.shp** - This file represents the NC state boundary plus a 10 km buffer which was calculated from nc_bounds_albers.shp (EPSG = 5070).
