**state_bounds_albers.shp** - This file represents the state boundaries for the United States. I projected **state_bounds.shp** in the state\_bounds\_raw directory to Albers Equal Area Conic.

**nc_bounds_albers.shp** - This file represents the NC state boundary which was filtered from state_bounds_albers.shp.

**nc_bounds_10kmbuf_albers.shp** - This file represents the NC state boundary plus a 10 km buffer which was calculated from nc_bounds_albers.shp.
