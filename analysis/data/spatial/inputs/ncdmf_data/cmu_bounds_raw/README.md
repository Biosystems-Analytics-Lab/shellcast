**NOTE:** Each .shp file is accompanied by several other files (e.g., .dpf, .prj, .shx, etc.). These files will have the same prefix (i.e., file descriptive name before the file extension) and to be downloaded together and stored together for the .shp file to functionp properly in any GIS program.

**cmu_bounds_raw_albers.shp** - This file represents a tidied up and projected (to CONUS Albers Equal Area, EPSG = 5070) version of Conditional_Management_Units.shp. Each polygon represents a Conditional Management Unit (CMU) along the NC coast. This file was generated by [ncdmf_tidy_cmu_bounds_script.R](/analysis/ncdmf_tidy_cmu_bounds_script.R). See this R script for more details.

**cmu_bounds_raw_valid_albers.shp** - This file is the same as cmu_bounds_raw_albers.shp but each CMU polygon has been validated to be spatially complete using QGIS functions. Further details on QGIS functions are included in [ncdmf_tidy_cmu_bounds_script.R](/analysis/ncdmf_tidy_cmu_bounds_script.R).

**Conditional_Management_Units.shp** - This file represents represents the NC DMF conditional management boundaries as they were last updated in October 2020.
