All files in this directory were generated by [ncdmf_tidy_sga_bounds_script.R](/analysis/ncdmf_tidy_cmu_bounds_script.R). See this R script for more details.

**NOTE:** Each .shp file is accompanied by several other files (e.g., .dpf, .prj, .shx, etc.). These files will have the same prefix (i.e., file descriptive name before the file extension) and to be downloaded together and stored together for the .shp file to functionp properly in any GIS program.

**sga_bounds_albers.shp** - This file represents a tidied up and projected (to CONUS Albers Equal Area, EPSG = 5070) data included in the original Shellfish Growing Area (SGA) spatial data provided by NC DMF. Each polygon represents a SGA along the NC coast.

**sga_bounds_class_albers.shp** - This file is a summarized version of sga_bounds_albers.shp that highlights the temporary closure classes of each SGA.

**sga_bounds_simple_albers.shp** - This file represents spatially simplified version of sga_bounds_albers.shp. We simplified this data reduce the number of interior lines within boundaries, which we preferred for plotting and visualizations.

**sga_bounds_10kmbuf_albers.shp** - This file represents a 10 km buffered polygon around a convex hull of the sga_bounds_albers.shp data.
