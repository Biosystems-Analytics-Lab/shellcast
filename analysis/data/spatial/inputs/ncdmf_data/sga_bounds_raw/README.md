**NOTE:** Each .shp file is accompanied by several other files (e.g., .dpf, .prj, .shx, etc.). These files will have the same prefix (i.e., file descriptive name before the file extension) and to be downloaded together and stored together for the .shp file to functionp properly in any GIS program.

**sga_bounds_raw_albers.shp** - This file represents a tidied up and projected (to CONUS Albers Equal Area, EPSG = 5070) version of SGA_Curent_Classifications.shp. Each polygon represents a Shellfish Growing Area (SGA) along the NC coast. This file was generated by [ncdmf_tidy_sga_bounds_script.R](/analysis/ncdmf_tidy_sga_bounds_script.R). See this R script for more details.

**sga_bounds_raw_valid_albers.shp** - This file is the same as sga_bounds_raw_albers.shp but each SGA polygon has been validated to be spatially complete using QGIS functions. Further details on QGIS functions are included in [ncdmf_tidy_sga_bounds_script.R](/analysis/ncdmf_tidy_sga_bounds_script.R).

**SGA_Curent_Classifications.shp** - This file represents represents the NC DMF shellfish growing areas as they were last updated in May 2019. There is some redundancy in the rows and columns of this data, which is why we tidied it up before using it for ShellCast.
