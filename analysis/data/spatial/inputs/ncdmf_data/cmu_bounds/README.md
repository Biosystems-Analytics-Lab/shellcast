All files in this directory were generated by [ncdmf_tidy_cmu_bounds_script.R](/analysis/ncdmf_tidy_cmu_bounds_script.R). See this R script for more details.

**NOTE:** Each .shp file is accompanied by several other files (e.g., .dpf, .prj, .shx, etc.). These files will have the same prefix (i.e., file descriptive name before the file extension) and to be downloaded together and stored together for the .shp file to functionp properly in any GIS program.

**cmu_bounds_albers.shp** - This file represents a tidied up and projected (to CONUS Albers Equal Area, EPSG = 5070) data included in the original Conditional Management Unit (CMU) spatial data provided by NC DMF. Each polygon represents a CMU along the NC coast.

**cmu_bounds_wgs84.geojson** - This file represents spatially simplified and projected (to lat/long WGS84) version of cmu_bounds_albers.shp that is required to display the CMU polygons on the ShellCast web application main map page. A geojson format is required to be compatible with the MySQL database that ShellCast uses.

**cmu_bounds_10kmbuf_albers.shp** - This file represents a 10 km buffered polygon around a convex hull of the cmu_bounds_albers.shp data.
