The following instructions assume that you are using [Sequel Pro](https://sequelpro.com/) as your database client.  Unfortunately, Sequel Pro is only available on Mac, however, you should be able to use any database client to access the database by following the instructions under [Connecting to Cloud SQL](#connecting-to-cloud-sql).  A powerful alternative to Sequel Pro is [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) which is free, open source, and multiplatform.
