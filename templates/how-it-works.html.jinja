    <h1>What is ShellCast?</h1>
    <p>
      ShellCast is a forecast tool that helps North Carolina shellfish
      growers anticipate temporary harvest area closures due to excess rainfall
      and make data-driven management decisions. Forecast information on temporary
      closures is helpful because closures impact business: shellfish growers cannot
      harvest shellfish when a temporary closure is in effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      ShellCast only offers forecasts of the percent chance of a growing area
      temporarily closing, and does not provide information on closures currently
      in effect. For more information on active closures, refer to proclamations
      posted by the
      <a href="http://portal.ncdenr.org/web/mf/proclamations-polluted-areas">North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries</a>
      or the <a href="https://ncdenr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=5759aa19d7484a3b82a8e440fba643aa">Shellfish Sanitation Temporary Closure Public Viewer</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>Why use ShellCast?</h1>
    <p>
      Once they sign up and log into their ShellCast account, shellfish growers
      can add their lease sites and view forecast information for each of their
      leases on the ShellCast map page. They can also see forecasts for nearby
      growing areas on this same map. The forecasts provide estimates on the
      percent chance that a lease site or growing area will temporarily close
      today, tomorrow, or in 2 days due to excess rainfall. It is beneficial to
      add leases because lease rainfall thresholds can vary and lead to different
      chances of closure even with the same growing area.
    </p>
    <p>
      While adding their leases to ShellCast, shellfish growers can also sign
      up to receive email or text message notifications if their shellfish
      lease sites are likely to be temporarily closed  today, tomorrow, or in
      2 days. Please note that leases outside of conditionally approved areas
      will not be searchable because ShellCast cannot generate a percent
      chance of closure for these leases.
    </p>
    <p>
      ShellCast is free to use, but carrier messaging rates may apply for those who
      subscribe to email or text notifications.

    <h1>How does ShellCast work?</h1>
    <p>
      Each day, we combine National Weather Service rainfall forecasts gathered
      through the <a href="https://climate.ncsu.edu/">North Carolina State Climate Office</a>
      with shellfish harvest area and grower lease information from the
      <a href="https://bit.ly/3e5mzxl">North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries</a>
      to calculate the percent chance of closure for each lease registered in ShellCast.
      We calculate the percent chance of closure using rainfall closure threshold depths
      from the <a href="http://portal.ncdenr.org/web/mf/shellfish-sanitation-and-recreational-water-quality">North Carolina Office of Shellfish Sanitation and Recreational Water Quality</a>.
      After calculating this percent chance of closure, we update the ShellCast web
      application, and send out notifications once daily at 7am ET.
    </p>

      src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/shellcast_infographic.png') }}"
      class="infographic"
      alt="Image showing ShellCast data analysis pipeline and outputs from gathering weather forecast data on far left (picture of thundercloud), to running analysis (picture of two gears), to updating the ShellCast web application (computer monitor with ShellCast logo), to notifiying users via text message or email of the percent chance of closure on the far right (cell phone with notification)."
    >
    <p>
      Shellfish growers using ShellCast can select a threshold above which they would
      like to receive email or text message notifications. For example, if they select
      a threshold of 75%, they will receive email or text notifications when one of
      their leases has a 75 percent chance or greater of closing today, tomorrow, or
      in 2 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      New users can start receiving ShellCast notifications as early as 7am ET the day
      after sign up. Whether they receive a ShellCast notification depends on the closure
      threshold they set in their notification settings and the percent chance and depth
      of forecasted rainfall in the next few days.  The “My Leases” table values on
      <a href="/">the main map page</a> will be populated as soon as leases are added and saved.
    </p>


    <h1>What do ShellCast values mean?</h1>
    <p>
      ShellCast provides users with two different scales of forecasts for three
      different time periods. The two different scales of forecasts include the
      larger shellfish growing units (e.g., the shaded boundaries on the main
      map page) and smaller shellfish lease boundaries (e.g., the pins on the
      main map page). You can also view this information in the two tables below
      the map. Note that shellfish growing units are smaller than shellfish
      growing areas, which are defined by the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Each forecasted percent chance of closure is available for three different
      time periods: today, tomorrow, and in 2 days. These forecasts are not
      cumulative. That is, the forecasted percent chance of closure in 2 days
      only accounts for the rain expected for a 24-hour period two days from now.
      The forecasted percent change of closure in 2 days does not consider rain
      that falls today and tomorrow. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, say you get the email below for one of your leases.
    </p>
    <img
      src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/example_email_notification.png') }}"
      alt="Screenshot of email notification showing forecasted percent chance of closure details for each lease and a link to return to the ShellCast web application to see more information."
      style="width: 100%;"
    >

    <p>
      In the example above, ShellCast is forecasting the percent chance of closure
      for today to be 20%, which is fairly low. Remember, anything less than 50%
      has worse odds than flipping a coin. However, there’s an 80% chance that
      your lease will be closed tomorrow and a smaller, but still greater than 50%,
      chance that your lease will be closed the day after tomorrow. Given this
      information and your knowledge of your shellfish operations, you may decide
      to harvest your shellfish today. Doing this means you would be able to get
      your shellfish to market sooner rather than waiting until your lease is
      potentially approved and reopened for harvest by the North Carolina Division
      of Marine Fisheries.

    <h1>What are we doing to improve ShellCast?</h1>
    <p>
      ShellCast is part of an ongoing research project led by researchers at
      NC State with support from <a href="/about#shellcast-support">NC Sea Grant</a>.
      This research focuses on improving the accuracy of rainfall forecasts
      for coastal North Carolina. Results of this study will be used to improve
      the ShellCast algorithm. Look back here for further updates on publications
      and reports regarding the performance of ShellCast.
