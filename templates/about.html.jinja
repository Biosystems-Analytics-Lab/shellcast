    <h1>What is ShellCast?</h1>
    <p>
      ShellCast is a forecast tool that helps North Carolina shellfish
      growers anticipate temporary harvest area closures due to excess rainfall
      and make data-driven management decisions. Forecast information on temporary
      closures is helpful because closures impact business: shellfish growers cannot
      harvest shellfish when a temporary closure is in effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      ShellCast only offers forecasts of the percent chance of a growing area
      temporarily closing, and does not provide information on closures currently
      in effect. For more information on active closures, refer to proclamations
      posted by the
      <a href="http://portal.ncdenr.org/web/mf/proclamations-polluted-areas">North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries</a>
      or the <a href="https://ncdenr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=5759aa19d7484a3b82a8e440fba643aa">Shellfish Sanitation Temporary Closure Public Viewer</a>.

    <h1>Why use ShellCast?</h1>
    <p>
      Once they sign up and log into their ShellCast account, shellfish growers can
      add their lease sites and view forecast information for each of their leases
      on the ShellCat map page. They can also see forecasts for nearby growing areas
      on this same map. The forecasts provide estimates on the percent chance that a
      lease site or growing area will temporarily close in the next 1-, 2-, or 3-days
      due to excess rainfall. It is beneficial to add leases because lease rainfall
      thresholds can vary and lead to different chances of closure even with the same
      growing area.
    </p>
    <p>
      While adding their leases to ShellCast, shellfish growers can also sign up to
      receive email or text message notifications if their shellfish lease sites are
      likely to be temporarily closed in the next 1-, 2-, or 3-days.
    </p>
    <p>
      ShellCast is free to use, but carrier messaging rates may apply for those who
      subscribe to email or text notifications.

    <h1>How does ShellCast work?</h1>
    <p>
      Each day, we combine National Weather Service rainfall forecasts gathered
      through the <a href="https://climate.ncsu.edu/">North Carolina State Climate Office</a>
      with shellfish harvest area and grower lease information from the
      <a href="https://bit.ly/3e5mzxl">North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries</a>
      to calculate probabilities of closure for each lease registered in ShellCast.
      We calculate the probability of closure using rainfall thresholds applied by
      the Office of Shellfish Sanitation and Recreational Water Quality. Shellfish
      growers using ShellCast can select a threshold above which they would like to
      receive email or text message notifications - for example, if they select a
      threshold of 75%, they will receive email or text notifications when one of
      their leases has a 75% or more chance of closing within the next 1 to 3 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      ShellCast is part of an ongoing research project led by NC State that focuses
      on improving the accuracy of rainfall forecasts for coastal North Carolina.
      Results of this study will be used to improve the ShellCast algorithm.
